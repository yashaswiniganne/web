                    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                    <p>Albert Einstein (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.)
                        was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists 
                        of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity.His mass–energy equivalence 
                        formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>First scientist to put forward the notion that light was both a wave and a particle. </li>
                        <li>He won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect.</li>
                        <li>Einstein traveled the world lecturing and raising funds for a planned Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</li>
                        <li>Professor of Theoretical Physics, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, 1933-1955.</li>
                        <li>In 1944 he hand wrote his 1905 theory on relativity and allowed it to be auctioned. 
                            It sold for six million dollars, which he donated to the effort to win World War II.</li>
